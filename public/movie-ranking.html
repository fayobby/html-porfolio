<h1>The Best Movies According to Faith</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>     
<hr>
<h3>WAR ROOM</h3>
<P>War room in this movie there's alot that one can learn but i love the fact that,it reminded me on the imporatance of prayer and reading of the word
    the more you thirt for the word of God, you can learn about him through reading the Bible and communicate to him through the prayers.

<h3>PITCH PERFECT</h3>
<P>Pitch Perfect is one of the best musical and one of my favourite and as much as i love the musical part of the it, the bigger message is find your passion,and don't
    be afraid to take risks.Open your heart to love,and it might find you. </P>
<h3>GREATEST SHOWMAN</h3>
<P>I love the music but also how the society might see you as useless but untill you find someone who believes in you and loves you 
    you can do anything when sorrounded with loving family.</P>
